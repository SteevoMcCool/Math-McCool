                <h2>Definition Of Limits</h2>
                <p>A limit of f(x) as x approaches a value descibes the behavior of the function around that value.</p>
                <p>In other words, a limit represents the y-value based on the function's curve, not the corresponding x-value. </p>

                <h2>Example of Limits</h2>
                <p> Let's suppose we define <span class="function"> f(x) =  <span class="divi"> <span class="num">(x-2)<sup>2</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num"> x-2</span> </span> </span>. If we were to try and calculate <span class="function">f(2)</span> we would get an error.</p>
                <p> This is because the denominator of <span class="function"> f(2)</span> is <span class="function">2-2</span>, which is zero. Since we cannot divide by zero, the <span class="function"> f(2) </span> is undefined. On the graph, there is a hole at <span class="function">x=2</span>.  </p>
                <p> However, using any of <b>3 methods</b>, we can still find <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->2</span></span> </p>

                <h2>Solving Limits Numerically (GC required)</h2>
                <p>Let's suppose we have the previous example of  <span class="function"> f(x) </span> and would like to solve it numerically. This means we are going to use a table of values to determine the limit. </p>
                <p>To get an accurate table of values on a graphing calculator, first enter the function in by pressing  <span class="gc">Y1</span> and typing the function into your calculator. Remember: Calculators follow pemdas, so parenthesis are important. Your function entry should look like <span class="gc">Y1=(x-2)<sup>2</sup>/(x-2) </span>. </p>
                <p>Once done, you need to access the calculator's table settings. To do this, press <span class="gc">2nd</span> + <span class="gc">window</span> (located next to the <span class="gc">Y1</span> button). Leave the bottom two options on <span class="gc"> Auto</span></span></p>
                <p>After that, change <span class="gc">TblStart</span> to the value that X is approaching. In this case, set  <span class="gc">TblStart=2</span>.Change the second option (Delta Table) to a relatively small number, <span class="function"><=0.01</span>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once you have your table set up, click <span class="gc">2nd</span> + <span class="gc">graph</span>. You should see a table similar to the table on the right. Scroll upwards until <span class="function">2</span> is in the middle.</p>
                <p>As you can see, as the x-values get closer to <span class="function">2</span>, the y-values get closer to <span class="function">0</span>.</p>
                <p>This means that we can conclude that <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x) = 0</span> <span class="limBottom">x->2</span></span></p>
                <p>Remember, the limit is determined by the behavoir around the point. So even though the point is undefined, there is still a limit at that point.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In my personal opinion, this is the best way to calculate limits. It is fast, simple, and removes any major chance of human error. However, you won't have a graphing calculator for all parts of the AP exam, so it is important to learn the other ways to find limits.</p>

                <h2>Solving Limits Graphically</h2>
                <p>Suppose the graph of <span class="function">g(x)</span> is to the right, and we needed to solve <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->4</span></span></p>
                <p>Since we don't have a function equation, we need to solve this limit graphically. To do this, give your best estimate for the function value of <span class="function">x=4</span>, which is 6. You can use a pencil and a straight-edge to help get your answer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In my personal opinion, this method should ONLY be used when you are only given a graph. There could be a high level of error with this method and is not recommended.</p>
