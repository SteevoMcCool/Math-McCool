                <h2>Definition Of Limits</h2>
                <p>A limit of f(x) as x approaches a value descibes the behavior of the function around that value.</p>
                <p>In other words, a limit represents the y-value based on the function's curve, not the corresponding x-value. </p>

                <h2>Example of Limits</h2>
                <p> Let's suppose we define <span class="function"> f(x) =  <span class="divi"> <span class="num">(x-2)<sup>2</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num"> x-2</span> </span> </span>. If we were to try and calculate <span class="function">f(2)</span> we would get an error.</p>
                <p> This is because the denominator of <span class="function"> f(2)</span> is <span class="function">2-2</span>, which is zero. Since we cannot divide by zero, the <span class="function"> f(2) </span> is undefined. On the graph, there is a hole at <span class="function">x=2</span>.  </p>
                <p> However, using any of <b>3 methods</b>, we can still find <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->2</span></span> </p>

                <h2>Solving Limits Numerically (GC required)</h2>
                <p>Let's suppose we have the previous example of  <span class="function"> f(x) </span> and would like to solve it numerically. This means we are going to use a table of values to determine the limit. </p>
                <p>To get an accurate table of values on a graphing calculator, first enter the function in by pressing  <span class="gc">Y1</span> and typing the function into your calculator. Remember: Calculators follow pemdas, so parenthesis are important. Your function entry should look like <span class="gc">Y1=(x-2)<sup>2</sup>/(x-2) </span>. </p>
                <p>Once done, you need to access the calculator's table settings. To do this, press <span class="gc">2nd</span> + <span class="gc">window</span> (located next to the <span class="gc">Y1</span> button). Leave the bottom two options on <span class="gc"> Auto</span></span></p>
                <p>After that, change <span class="gc">TblStart</span> to the value that X is approaching. In this case, set  <span class="gc">TblStart=2</span>.Change the second option (Delta Table) to a relatively small number, <span class="function"><=0.01</span>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once you have your table set up, click <span class="gc">2nd</span> + <span class="gc">graph</span>. You should see a table similar to the table on the right. Scroll upwards until <span class="function">2</span> is in the middle.</p>
                <p>As you can see, as the x-values get closer to <span class="function">2</span>, the y-values get closer to <span class="function">0</span>.</p>
                <p>This means that we can conclude that <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x) = 0</span> <span class="limBottom">x->2</span></span></p>
                <p>Remember, the limit is determined by the behavoir around the point. So even though the point is undefined, there is still a limit at that point.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In my personal opinion, this is the best way to calculate limits. It is fast, simple, and removes any major chance of human error. However, you won't have a graphing calculator for all parts of the AP exam, so it is important to learn the other ways to find limits.</p>

                <h2>Solving Limits Graphically</h2>
                <p>Suppose the graph of <span class="function">g(x)</span> is to the right, and we needed to solve <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->4</span></span></p>
                <p>Since we don't have a function equation, we need to solve this limit graphically. To do this, give your best estimate for the function value of <span class="function">x=4</span>, which is 6. You can use a pencil and a straight-edge to help get your answer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In my personal opinion, this method should ONLY be used when you are only given a graph. There could be a high level of error with this method and is not recommended.</p>

            <h2>Solving Limits Algebraically</h2> 
            <p>Let's define <span class="function">f(x) = <span class="divi"> <span class="num"> x<sup>2</sup>+5x+6 </span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x+3</span>  </span> </span> and attempt to find <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->-3</span> </span> </p>
            <p>Your first step is to check if direct substiution will work by plugging <span class="function">-3</span> into the denominator. When you do this, you get <span class="function">-3 + 3 = 0</span>, which is a divide by zero error. Direct substiution won't work yet. </p>
            <p>The next step is to check if <span class="function">x-3</span> is a factor of the numerator. To do this, you can factor the numerator using quadratic factorting, which results in <span class="function">(x+2)(x+3)</span>. Your function now looks like <span class="function">f(x) = <span class="divi"> <span class="num">(x+2)(x+3)</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x+3</span> </span> </span> </p>
            <p>You can then cancel the <span class="function">x+3</span> in the numerator with the <span class="function">x+3</span> in the denominator. This looks like <span class="function"> <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"> <span class="num">(x+2)<del>(x+3)</del></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num"><del>x+3</del></span> </span>  </span><span class = "limBottom"  style="bottom: 16px;">x->-3</span> </span> = <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim x+2 </span> <span class="limBottom"> x-> -3</span> </span> </span> </p>
            <p>Now you can directly substitute <span class="function"">-3</span> into <span class="function">x+2 --> -3+2 --> -1 </span></p>
           <p> <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x) = -1 </span> <span class="limBottom">x->-3</span> </span> </p>

                <h3>The Squeeze/Sandwhich Theorem</h3>
                <p>This Theorem attempts to find the limit of a function by "Sandwhiching" or squeezing it between 2 other functions.</p>
                <p><span class="lim">
                    <span class="limMain">lim x<sup>2</sup> * sin(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>x</sub>)</span>
                    <span class="limBottom">x -> 0</span>
                </span></p>
                <p>Since direct substitiotion won't work, we can Sandwhich this function between 2 functions. We know that sin() of anything is always inbetween -1 and 1, so we can say:</p>
                <p><span class="function">-1 &#8804 sin(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>x</sub>) &#8804 1</span> </p>
                <p>Now, we can multiply the entire inequality by x<sup>2</sup> to get: <span class="function">-x<sup>2</sup> &#8804 x<sup>2</sup> * sin(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>x</sub>) &#8804 x<sup>2</sup></span> Now let's take the limit to zero of all these:</p>
                <p>
                <span class="function">
                    <span class="lim" style="text-align: left;"><span class="limMain"> lim -x<sup>2</sup> </span><span class="limBottom">x->0</span></span>
                    &#8804 
                    <span class="lim" style="text-align: left;"><span class="limMain">lim x<sup>2</sup> * sin(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>x</sub>)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->0</span> </span>
                    &#8804 
                    <span class="lim" style="text-align: left;"><span class="limMain">lim x<sup>2</sup></span><span class="limBottom" >x->0</span></span>
                    &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0 &#8804 <span class="lim" style="text-align: left;"><span class="limMain">lim x<sup>2</sup> * sin(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>x</sub>)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->0</span> </span> &#8804 0
                    Then boom! We know the answer is inbetween zero and zero, so we know the answer is zero!
                </span>

            <div class="doubleRow2">
                <h3>The Reciprocal Theorem</h3>
                <p>This Theorem attempts to find the limit of a <span class="function">f(x)</span> to zero by taking the limit of the <span class="function">f(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>x</sub>)</span> to infinity </p>
                <p><span class="lim">
                    <span class="limMain">lim x<sup>2</sup> * sin(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>x</sub>)</span>
                    <span class="limBottom">x -> 0</span>
                </span></p>
                <p>Since direct substitiotion won't work, we can Recipricol this function. When we do that, we get  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>x<sup>2</sup></sub> * sin(x)</p>
                <p>Now we need to find <span class="lim" style="text-align:left">
                    <span class="limMain" style="text-align:left">lim <sup>1</sup>/<sub>x<sup>2</sup></sub> * sin(x)</span>
                    <span class="limBottom">x -> &infin;</span>
                </span></p>
                <p>Then very easily, we know that the end behavior rules will follow <sup>1</sup>/<sub>x<sup>2</sup></sub>. This is because as <span class="function">x-> &infin;</span>, x continuously gets bigger (meaning <sup>1</sup>/<sub>x<sup>2</sup></sub> gets a lot smaller), whereas sin(x) is always inbetween -1 and 1. Therefore, we know this limit is the same as   
                <span class="lim">
                    <span class="limMain">lim <sup>1</sup>/<sub>x<sup>2</sup></sub></span>
                    <span class="limBottom">x -> &infin;</span>
                </span>, which is zero :). For more on end behavior and limits to infinity, <a href="#infinf">click here</a></p>

                <p>As much as I love limits, sadly, they don't always have my back. It's kind of an abusive relationship. Anyways, they wont always exist.</p>
                <p>They wont exist when the left side of the function and the right side of the function approach different points (see example 1)</p>
                <p>The limit wont exist if either side of the function approaches infinity (denote it as infinity, see example 2)</p>
                <p>The linit wont exist if the function is oscilatting (going up and down rly fast). You can identify oscilation by checking if the frequency of waves is increasing exponentially. (see example 3)</p>
                <p><b>The fourth image represents a false oscilation: the limit exists at all points there.</b> </p>

                <h2>One Sided Limits</h2>
                <p>Let's denote <span class="function">f(x)</span> as the function that forms the graph on the right. Let's attempt to solve <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim f(x) </span> <span class="limBottom">x->0</span> </span> graphically. </p>
                <p>As you can see, the graph clearly approaches 1 from the right, and -1 from the left. However, as stated above, this means <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim f(x) DNE </span> <span class="limBottom">x->0</span> </span> </p>
                <p>However, if we wanted to determine the limit from the left, we would denote this as  <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim f(x) </span> <span class="limBottom">x->0<sup>-</sup></span></span>. Notice the negative sign AFTER the zero. This only accounts for all the points left of zero, so the answer is <span class="function"> -1</span>. To repeat the process from the right, we would do <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim f(x) = +1 </span> <span class="limBottom">x->0<sup>+</sup></span></span> </p>
                <p>To solve this numerically, you can use a table similar to the one on the right, but only focus on the part of the table you need (for left-hand limits, use the top half of the table. For right-hand limits, use the bottom half). </p>

            <h2>Types of Discontinuities</h2>
            <p>A continuous function is a function with no jumps, holes, or vertical asymtopes*. For example, <span class="function">y= e<sup>x</sup></span> is continuous, buy <span class="function"> y= 1/x </span> is not. You can prove continuity of <span class="function">f(x), x=c</span>  by stating <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>-</sup></span> </span> = <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x) = f(c)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>+</sup></span>   </span>                   </p>
            <p> A removable discontinuity looks like a hole in the graph. Essentially, if you just shaded over that one point, the graph would be continuous. You can prove a removable discontinuity by stating <span class="function"><span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>-</sup></span> </span> = <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>+</sup></span> </span>    </span>, and <span class="function"><span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>-</sup></span> </span> &ne; f(c)   </span>  </p>
            <p> A jump discontinuity looks like a gap between 2 points (refer to <a href = "#Jump">this function)</a>. You can prove a jump discontinuity by stating the left and right handed limits arent equal, but both limits exist.</p>
            <p> You can prove an <b>INFINITE DISCONTINUITY</b> by proving at least one of the one-sided limits goes to infinity. This is also called a VERTICAL ASYMPTOPE </p>
            <p> You won't recieve an oscilatting discontinuity, but in most cases, it follows the behavior of a removable discontinuity inside of a wavy function.</p>

            <h2>Properties Of Limits</h2>
            <p>The properities of limits say that, for any limit, you can separate any operation and take the limit of both parts. For example: </p>
            <p><span class="function"><span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x)*g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>  = <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>  * <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>|| &nbsp &nbsp ||<span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x) - g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>  = <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>  - <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span> </span> </p>                                                                                                                                        
            <p> These rules apply for all operations, not just addition and subtraction. We can use these rules to solve limits of special values.</p>
            <p>Let's attempt to solve <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num"> sin 4x</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x </span> </span> + 1 </span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom:16px;">x->0</span> </span> </p>
            <p>Using the properties of limits, we know <span class="function"> <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num"> sin 4x</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span> </span> + 1 </span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom:16px;">x->0</span> </span> =   <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num"> sin 4x</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span> </span></span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom:16px;">x->0</span> </span>  + <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim 1 </span> <span class="limBottom">x->0</span> </span> </span>. Since we know that the limit of a constant is the constant, we can rewrite this as <span class="function"> 1 + <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num"> sin 4x</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span> </span></span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom:16px;">x->0</span> </span></span></p>
            <p>Let's multiply the limit by <span class="function">4/4</span>, aka one. When we do this, we get <span class="function"> 1 + <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num"> 4 * sin 4x</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">4x</span> </span></span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom:16px;">x->0</span> </span></span>, which we can now rewrite as <span class="function"> 1 + <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num"> sin 4x</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span> </span></span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom:16px;">x->0</span> </span></span>. Using properties of limits, we can separate this into, <span class="function"> 1 + <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim 4</span> <span class="limBottom">x -> 0</span> </span> * <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num"> sin 4x</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span> </span></span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom:16px;">x->0</span> </span></span>. </p>
            <p>By remembering the table to the right, we can recognize that <span class="function"><span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num"> sin 4x</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span> </span></span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom:16px;">x->0</span> </span> = 1</span>, as it follows the <span class="gc">Limits to Zero With Sine</span> rule.</p>

            <h2> Advanced Algebraic Solving </h2>
            <p>Now let's attemt to solve a tricky limit. <span class ="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"> <span class="num">2 - &#8730(4-x)</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span> </span> </span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom:16px">x->0</span> </span>. Uh oh! Direct substitiution won't work and we can't cancel from numerator to denominator. Luckily, we can use conjugates to simplify this fraction and get the limit. First, we need to identify the conjugate of the numerator. The conjugate of the numerator is <span class="function">2 +  &#8730(4+x)</span>. All we did was change the sign in the middle. The next step is to multiply the limit by the conjugate over itself. </p>
            <p>uh oh here goes nth</p>
            <p><span class="function"><span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"> <span class="num">2 - &#8730(4-x)</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span> </span> </span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 16px;">x ->0</span>  </span>  *  <span class="divi"> <span class="num"> 2 + &#8730(4-x) </span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">2 + &#8730(4-x)</span></span></span>. After all simplification, you should get <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"> <span class="num">4 -(4-x)</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x(2 + &#8730(4-x))</span> </span> </span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 16px;">x ->0</span> </span> Once done, you can further simplify the numerator as such: <span class="function">4-(4-x) = 4-4+x = x</span>. Now you can cancel the <span class="function">x</span> in the denominator with the <span class="function">x</span> in the numerator. Your new limit should look like:</p>
            <p><span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"> <span class="num">1</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">2 + &#8730(4-x)</span> </span> </span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 16px;">x ->0</span>  </span>. Now you can direct substitute and get <span class="function">1/4</span> as your answer. </p>

            <h2>Limits to Infinity/ End Behavior Model</h2>
            <p>You should know the basic shapes of graphs and functions. For exapmle, <span class="function">f(x)=x<sup>2</sup> - x + 1</span> is a parabola. But what if we did: <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim x<sup>2</sup> - x + 1</span> <span class="limBottom">x->&infin;</span> </span>. To do this, we use an <b>end behavior model (EBM)</b>.</p>
            <p>An EBM is a shorthand way to describe how a function behaves as it gets closer and closer to infinity. <b> <u>The EBM of all polynomial functions is the term with the highest degree.</u> </b></p>
            <p>An EBM can be for only the left (LEBM) or the right (REBM) of a function. To prove <span class="function">E(x)</span> is a LEBM of <span class="function">f(x)</span>, you must prove <span class="function"><span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">f(x)</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">E(x)</span> </span> = 1</span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 16px">x->-&infin;</span></span>, and to prove REBM: <span class="function"><span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">f(x)</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">E(x)</span> </span> = 1</span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 16px">x->+&infin;</span></span> </span></p>
            <p>If either EBM is a constant  (ie <span class="function">LEBM of f(X)=4</span>), then that constant is a <b>Horizontal Asymtope</b> of that function.</p>
            
            <p>Let's do 2 examples. First, let's return to our original function, <span class="function">f(x)=x<sup>2</sup> - x + 1</span>. We know the EBM of this function is <span class="function">E(x)=x<sup>2</sup></span>, but now, let's prove it. To do this, we must keep in mind the shape of y=<span class="divi"> <span class="num">1</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span>.</span> For this proof, we need to do  <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">x<sup>2</sup> - x + 1</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup>></span> </span> </span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 16px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span></span>. Using alegbra, this limit is equal to <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span> - <span class="divi"><span class="num">x</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span> + <span class="divi"><span class="num">2</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span></span> <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 16px; right:8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span></span>. Using properties of limits, we can break this down even further, into:
            <span class="function">
                <span class="lim">
                    <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span></span>
                    <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
                </span> - 
                <span class="lim">
                    <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">x</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span></span>
                    <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
                </span> + 
                <span class="lim">
                    <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">2</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span></span>
                    <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
                </span>
            </span>. </p> <p>Now we can solve each limit individually. First we know 
            <span class="function">
                <span class="lim">
                    <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span></span>
                    <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
                </span> = 1
            </span>, because the numerator and the denominator reduce completely to one. Secondly, you can cancel an <span class="function">x</span> from the numerator and the denominator.
            <span class="function">
                <span class="lim">
                    <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num"><del>x</del></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x * <del>x</del></sup></span> </span></span>
                    <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
                </span> =  
                <span class="lim">
                    <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">1</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x</span> </span></span>
                    <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
                </span>.
            </span>  If you remember the shape of this common function, you'd know this limit to +&infin; or -&infin; is zero (therefore there is a horizontal asymtope for <span class="function">1/x</span> at <span class="function">y=0</span>). Finally, we have:
            <span class="lim">
                <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">2</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span></span>
                <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
            </span>. We also know this graph has a horizontal asymtope at <span class="function">x=0</span>, so this limit is also zero, 
            </p>
            <p> After solving all those limits, we did
                <span class="function">
                    <span class="lim">
                        <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span></span>
                        <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
                    </span> - 
                    <span class="lim">
                        <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">x</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span></span>
                        <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
                    </span> + 
                    <span class="lim">
                        <span class = "limMain">lim <span class="divi"><span class="num">2</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x<sup>2</sup></span> </span></span>
                        <span class="limBottom" style="bottom: 18px; right: 8px">x-> <span style="font-size: 4px;">&#8723;</span> &infin;</span>
                    </span> =
                    1 - 0 + 0 = 1.
                </span>. 
                Since this limit is 1, we know <span class="function">E(x)=x<sup>2</sup></span> is the LEBM, REBM, and EBM of <span class="function">f(x)=x<sup>2</sup> - x + 1</span>
                <p> For the second example, we will find the EBM of <span class="function">x<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>x</sup></span>. AH, we have a PROBLEMO! One of the exponents is a variable, so how would we know which term has the higher degree. Well, we know that when <span class="function"> x < 2</span>, the exponent of <span class="function">3<sup>x</sup></span> is also going to be less than 2. Which means that since as x goes to the left, where all numbers are <span class="function"> < 2 </span>, we know that <span class="function">E<sub>L</sub>(x)= x<sup>2</sup></span> is the LEMB. This also means we know that <span class="function">E<sub>R</sub>(x)= 3<sup>x</sup></span> is the REBM.</p>

        <p>First, you have to find the left- and right-handed limits of g(x) at 3. Then, you look at whether g(x) is increasing or decreasing on each side. Let's say that the right-handed limit ends up being a and the left-handed being b.</p>
        <p>Then, you look at either the right- or left-handed limit of h(x) as x->a. If g(x) was decreasing on the right side, then you find the left-handed limit, and if it was increasing you find the right. Now do the same thing, but instead of the limit as x->a, find the limit as x->b. Remember that now we're looking on the left side of g(x) to determine whether or not it's increasing.</p>
        <p>Finally, compare the two limits you got in the previous step. If they're the same value, your limit exits and you just found it! Otherwise, we can say that <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x) DNE.</span> <span class="limBottom">x->-3</span></p>
