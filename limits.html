                <h2>Definition Of Limits</h2>
                <p>A limit of f(x) as x approaches a value descibes the behavior of the function around that value.</p>
                <p>In other words, a limit represents the y-value based on the function's curve, not the corresponding x-value. </p>

                <h2>Example of Limits</h2>
                <p> Let's suppose we define <span class="function"> f(x) =  <span class="divi"> <span class="num">(x-2)<sup>2</sup></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num"> x-2</span> </span> </span>. If we were to try and calculate <span class="function">f(2)</span> we would get an error.</p>
                <p> This is because the denominator of <span class="function"> f(2)</span> is <span class="function">2-2</span>, which is zero. Since we cannot divide by zero, the <span class="function"> f(2) </span> is undefined. On the graph, there is a hole at <span class="function">x=2</span>.  </p>
                <p> However, using any of <b>3 methods</b>, we can still find <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->2</span></span> </p>

                <h2>Solving Limits Numerically (GC required)</h2>
                <p>Let's suppose we have the previous example of  <span class="function"> f(x) </span> and would like to solve it numerically. This means we are going to use a table of values to determine the limit. </p>
                <p>To get an accurate table of values on a graphing calculator, first enter the function in by pressing  <span class="gc">Y1</span> and typing the function into your calculator. Remember: Calculators follow pemdas, so parenthesis are important. Your function entry should look like <span class="gc">Y1=(x-2)<sup>2</sup>/(x-2) </span>. </p>
                <p>Once done, you need to access the calculator's table settings. To do this, press <span class="gc">2nd</span> + <span class="gc">window</span> (located next to the <span class="gc">Y1</span> button). Leave the bottom two options on <span class="gc"> Auto</span></span></p>
                <p>After that, change <span class="gc">TblStart</span> to the value that X is approaching. In this case, set  <span class="gc">TblStart=2</span>.Change the second option (Delta Table) to a relatively small number, <span class="function"><=0.01</span>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once you have your table set up, click <span class="gc">2nd</span> + <span class="gc">graph</span>. You should see a table similar to the table on the right. Scroll upwards until <span class="function">2</span> is in the middle.</p>
                <p>As you can see, as the x-values get closer to <span class="function">2</span>, the y-values get closer to <span class="function">0</span>.</p>
                <p>This means that we can conclude that <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x) = 0</span> <span class="limBottom">x->2</span></span></p>
                <p>Remember, the limit is determined by the behavoir around the point. So even though the point is undefined, there is still a limit at that point.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In my personal opinion, this is the best way to calculate limits. It is fast, simple, and removes any major chance of human error. However, you won't have a graphing calculator for all parts of the AP exam, so it is important to learn the other ways to find limits.</p>

                <h2>Solving Limits Graphically</h2>
                <p>Suppose the graph of <span class="function">g(x)</span> is to the right, and we needed to solve <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->4</span></span></p>
                <p>Since we don't have a function equation, we need to solve this limit graphically. To do this, give your best estimate for the function value of <span class="function">x=4</span>, which is 6. You can use a pencil and a straight-edge to help get your answer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In my personal opinion, this method should ONLY be used when you are only given a graph. There could be a high level of error with this method and is not recommended.</p>

            <h2>Solving Limits Algebraically</h2> 
            <p>Let's define <span class="function">f(x) = <span class="divi"> <span class="num"> x<sup>2</sup>+5x+6 </span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x+3</span>  </span> </span> and attempt to find <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->-3</span> </span> </p>
            <p>Your first step is to check if direct substiution will work by plugging <span class="function">-3</span> into the denominator. When you do this, you get <span class="function">-3 + 3 = 0</span>, which is a divide by zero error. Direct substiution won't work yet. </p>
            <p>The next step is to check if <span class="function">x-3</span> is a factor of the numerator. To do this, you can factor the numerator using quadratic factorting, which results in <span class="function">(x+2)(x+3)</span>. Your function now looks like <span class="function">f(x) = <span class="divi"> <span class="num">(x+2)(x+3)</span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num">x+3</span> </span> </span> </p>
            <p>You can then cancel the <span class="function">x+3</span> in the numerator with the <span class="function">x+3</span> in the denominator. This looks like <span class="function"> <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim <span class="divi"> <span class="num">(x+2)<del>(x+3)</del></span> <span class="bar"></span> <span class="num"><del>x+3</del></span> </span>  </span><span class = "limBottom"  style="bottom: 16px;">x->-3</span> </span> = <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim x+2 </span> <span class="limBottom"> x-> -3</span> </span> </span> </p>
            <p>Now you can directly substitute <span class="function"">-3</span> into <span class="function">x+2 --> -3+2 --> -1 </span></p>
           <p> <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x) = -1 </span> <span class="limBottom">x->-3</span> </span> </p>

                <h2>Where Limits Dont exist</h2>
                <p>As much as I love limits, sadly, they don't always have my back. It's kind of an abusive relationship. Anyways, they wont always exist.</p>
                <p>They wont exist when the left side of the function and the right side of the function approach different points (see example 1)</p>
                <p>The limit wont exist if either side of the function approaches infinity (denote it as infinity, see example 2)</p>
                <p>The linit wont exist if the function is oscilatting (going up and down rly fast). You can identify oscilation by checking if the frequency of waves is increasing exponentially. (see example 3)</p>
                <p><b>The fourth image represents a false oscilation: the limit exists at all points there.</b> </p>

                <h2>One Sided Limits</h2>
                <p>Let's denote <span class="function">f(x)</span> as the function that forms the graph on the right. Let's attempt to solve <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim f(x) </span> <span class="limBottom">x->0</span> </span> graphically. </p>
                <p>As you can see, the graph clearly approaches 1 from the right, and -1 from the left. However, as stated above, this means <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim f(x) DNE </span> <span class="limBottom">x->0</span> </span> </p>
                <p>However, if we wanted to determine the limit from the left, we would denote this as  <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim f(x) </span> <span class="limBottom">x->0<sup>-</sup></span></span>. Notice the negative sign AFTER the zero. This only accounts for all the points left of zero, so the answer is <span class="function"> -1</span>. To repeat the process from the right, we would do <span class="lim"><span class="limMain"> lim f(x) = +1 </span> <span class="limBottom">x->0<sup>+</sup></span></span> </p>
                <p>To solve this numerically, you can use a table similar to the one on the right, but only focus on the part of the table you need (for left-hand limits, use the top half of the table. For right-hand limits, use the bottom half). </p>

            <h2>Types of Discontinuities</h2>
            <p>A continuous function is a function with no jumps, holes, or vertical asymtopes*. For example, <span class="function">y= e<sup>x</sup></span> is continuous, buy <span class="function"> y= 1/x </span> is not. You can prove continuity of <span class="function">f(x), x=c</span>  by stating <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>-</sup></span> </span> = <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x) = f(c)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>+</sup></span>   </span>                   </p>
            <p> A removable discontinuity looks like a hole in the graph. Essentially, if you just shaded over that one point, the graph would be continuous. You can prove a removable discontinuity by stating <span class="function"><span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>-</sup></span> </span> = <span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>+</sup></span> </span>    </span>, and <span class="function"><span class="lim"> <span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c<sup>-</sup></span> </span> != f(c)   </span>  </p>
            <p> A jump discontinuity looks like a gap between 2 points (refer to <a href = "#Jump">this function)</a>. You can prove a jump discontinuity by stating the left and right handed limits arent equal, but both limits exist.</p>
            <p> You can prove an <b>INFINITE DISCONTINUITY</b> by proving at least one of the one-sided limits goes to infinity. This is also called a VERTICAL ASYMPTOPE </p>
            <p> You won't recieve an oscilatting discontinuity, but in most cases, it follows the behavior of a removable discontinuity inside of a wavy function.</p>

            <h2>Properties Of Limits</h2>
            <p>The properities of limits say that, for any limit, you can separate any operation and take the limit of both parts. For example: </p>
            <p><span class="function"><span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x)*g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>  = <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>  * <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>|| &nbsp &nbsp ||<span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x) - g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>  = <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim f(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span>  - <span class="lim"><span class="limMain">lim g(x)</span> <span class="limBottom">x->c</span> </span> </span> </p>                                                                                                                                        
            <p> These rules apply for all operations, not just addition and subtraction. We can use these rules to solve limits of special values.</p>
